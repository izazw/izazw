# Hi, I'm Iza (🗣️ *EE-zah*) 👋!

## I'm a Front-End Developer with a background in the operations of some cool IT companies
* 💻 My tech stack includes React, Javascript, HTML5, and CSS.
* 👩‍💻I’m currently looking for a job! I'm also looking for opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects related to social and climate impact.
* 👯 I love learning and I make good use of all the mentoring opportunities that help me grow as a developer.
* 🌱 I’m recently working on widening my JavaScript skills and learning Jest and Typescript.

## I'm a human 
* I solve problems 💡 and I use tech to achieve that. I love to share my knowledge too! 
* I live in Ottawa where I work 👩🏼‍💻, hike 🏔️, read 📖, raise kids🤸🏻‍♀️ and cats 🐈, and grow tomatoes 🍅!
* 💬 I'm happy to talk about learning, coding, books, switching to tech while being a mom
* ⚡ Fun fact: I used to run a foster home for homeless cats (and hosted 50 of them over a period of a few years).
